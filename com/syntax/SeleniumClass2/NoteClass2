What is a web element?

WEB element-anything presented on the web page;
e.g. buttons, taxtboxes,checkboxes;

HTML?
HyperText Markup Language

What is DOM?
Dom stands for Document Object Model.
It is a browser's internal view of the web page;(DEVELOPERS TOOLS
 -another way of calling DOM).
 Document -- because in html you can store any document (pdf,excel,word).
 Object -- any line inside html is called an object.
 Model  -- layout of the HTML file.

Locator is an address for a position of a web element in the webpage.
Is used to locate or identify a specific element on the web page.

There are 8 locators in SELENIUM:
--id
--name
--class name
--linkText
--partialLinkText
--xpath
--cssSelector
--tagName

HTML scripting meaning:
- purple - <tags>
- brown - attributes
- blue - attribute values(after the = and in "")


Why do we need many locators?
-- developers may not provide all the locators for elements
-- some locators might have duplicate values in the other notes
-- some locators may not be applicable to all the elements

e g. LinkText and PartialLinkText are only used for links;


"a" tag in HTML is  called an anchor tag.
